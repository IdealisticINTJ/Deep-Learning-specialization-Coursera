# Deep Learning specialization, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
### Become a Deep Learning expert. Master the fundamentals of deep learning and break into AI.
Instructor: Andrew Ng, [deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai/).

## Course 1 : Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In this course, the foundations of deep learning were covered. The major learnings after completing this course were :
 - Understood the major technology trends driving Deep Learning.
 - Been able to build, train and apply Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks.
 - Learnt how to implement efficient (Vectorized) neural networks.
 - Understood the key parameters in a neural network's architecture.
 - This course also taught how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description.

## Course 2 : Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
In this 2nd course of the specialization, the fundamentals of deep learning were further explored. The major learnings after completing this course were :
 - Learnt the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications.
 - Understood how to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking.
 - Learnt how to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence.
 - Understood the implementation of a neural network in TensorFlow.
