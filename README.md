# Deep Learning specialization, Coursera
### Become a Deep Learning expert. Master the fundamentals of deep learning and break into AI.
Instructor: Andrew Ng, deeplearning.ai.

## Course 1 : Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In this course, the foundations of deep learning were covered. The major learnings after completing this course were :
 - Understood the major technology trends driving Deep Learning.
 - Been able to build, train and apply Fully Connected Deep Neural Networks.
 - Learnt how to implement efficient (Vectorized) neural networks.
 - Understood the key parameters in a neural network's architecture.
 - This course also taught how Deep Learning actually works, rather than presenting only a cursory or surface-level description.

## Course 2 : Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
In this 2nd course of the specialization, the fundamentals of deep learning were further explored. The major learnings after completing this course were :
 - Learnt the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications.
 - Understood how to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking.
 - Learnt how to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence.
 - Understood the implementation of a neural network in TensorFlow.
 
 
## Overview
I have completed many CS related MOOCs on Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Edx. Therfore, I do understand that it is not all 'smooth sailing' in understanding new concepts and debugging your erroneous program. Here, I released these solutions, only for one's reference purposes. It may save you some time and help you get back on track in case you get stuck somewhere along the course. 
However, I hope you don't copy any part of the code (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully), or see the quiz solutions before you start your own adventure with this wonderful course. 
This course is one of the most straightforward deep learning courses I have taken. The fabulous course content and structure aided in augmenting my understanding of the fundamentals of this field and provided deeper insights to get started with DL.

## TL;DR
The solutions uploaded here are only for reference. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. 
Try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions.
